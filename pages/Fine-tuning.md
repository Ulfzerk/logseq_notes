- What is Fine-tuning? #card
	- It is a training done after model has been pretrained [[pretraining]]
	- The goal is to train model to perform specific task after pretraining.
- How to fine-tune a model? #card
	- To perform fine-tuning, acquire a pretrained model
	- Perform additional training with dataset specific for a task e.g. classification
- Why do we want to fine-tune a pretrained model instead of training model from scrach? #card
	- Pretrained model was already trained on dataset that has some similarities with the fine-tuning dataset.
	- Fine-tuning requires less data than training from scrach
	- For the same reason it is faster.
