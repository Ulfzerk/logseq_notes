- An autoencoder is a type of artificial neural network used to learn efficient codings of unlabeled data (unsupervised learning)
	- It learns an encoding function that transforms the input data and decoding function that recreates the input data from the encoded representation.
	- Regularized autoencoders types:
		- Sparse
		- Denoising
		- Contractive
- ### Use cases
	- [[Transformer]]
	- [[Dimensionality reduction]]
	- [[Variational autoencoders]]
	- Problem
