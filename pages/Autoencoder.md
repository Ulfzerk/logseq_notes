- An autoencoder is a type of artificial neural network used to learn efficient codings of unlabeled data (unsupervised learning)
	- It learns an encoding function that transforms the input data and decoding function that recreates the input data from the encoded representation.
	- **Regularized autoencoders types:**
		- Sparse
		- Denoising
		- Contractive
	- Autoencoders are generative models which can randomly generate new data that is similar to the input data (training data)

- ### Use cases
	- [[Transformer]]
	- [[Dimensionality reduction]]
	- [[Variational autoencoders]]
	- Autoencoders are applied to many problems like:
		- [[Facial recognition]],
		- [[Feature detection]]
		- [[Anomaly detection]]
		- Acquiring the meaning of words (word embeddings?)
		- Data generation
