- Zero-shot classification is a type of machine learning task where a model is required to classify instances into categories that were not seen during training. This technique is particularly useful when labeling new or unseen classes is impractical, and it allows models to generalize to new situations based on high-level descriptions or knowledge.
  
  In zero-shot learning, the model leverages semantic information or external knowledge (like word embeddings, textual descriptions, or attributes) about the unseen classes to make predictions. This differs from traditional classification, where the model is trained with labeled examples for every class it will encounter during inference.
- **How It Works:**
	- **Pretraining on Known Classes:** The model is initially trained on a set of classes for which labeled examples are available.
	- **Leveraging Semantic Relationships:** The model uses information like word embeddings or other representations that capture relationships between class labels, allowing it to infer similarities between seen and unseen classes.
	- **Predicting Unseen Classes:** At inference time, the model is presented with samples from unseen classes, but based on the semantic relationships, it can correctly classify them even without having seen examples of those classes during training.
- **Examples**
	- Consider a model trained to classify animals into known categories like "dog," "cat," and "horse." Now, it's asked to classify a new animal, say "zebra," for which it has not seen any training examples. The model is provided with a description of a "zebra" such as "an animal with black and white stripes." Using this description and its knowledge of known classes, the model can infer that the unseen category "zebra" is different from the others and correctly classify it as a "zebra."
	- A model is trained to classify sentiments into predefined categories such as "positive" and "negative." However, during inference, it is asked to classify text into a new sentiment, like "sarcastic." Even though it was never trained specifically on the "sarcastic" label, the model could be given a description of sarcasm and use this information to recognize and label new instances of sarcasm.
- ### **Applications:**
	- **Image Classification:** In visual tasks, zero-shot models can classify unseen objects or species by leveraging semantic embeddings (e.g., word2vec) of class names.
	- **Text Classification:** In NLP, zero-shot learning can be applied to text categorization problems where new topics or themes are introduced without labeled examples.
	- **Action Recognition:** For tasks like video understanding, zero-shot learning can help identify new actions based on descriptions (e.g., "cooking" or "dancing") without labeled video data.
- ### **Advantages:**
	- **Scalability:** Zero-shot learning eliminates the need for extensive labeled data for every possible class.
	- **Flexibility:** Models can generalize to new categories without retraining, which is especially valuable in dynamic environments where new categories frequently emerge.
- ### **Challenges:**
- **Accuracy:** Zero-shot models might struggle with classes that are semantically similar but differ in subtle ways, especially if the provided descriptions or embeddings are not sufficiently discriminative.
- **Domain Shift:** There can be a mismatch between the distribution of seen and unseen classes, which may reduce performance when moving to novel classes.
