- Note generation:
	- ```Create a note about {topic}```
- cards prompt
	- ````markdown
	  I'm using logseq software for notes, which allows to make flash cards. 
	  It uses markdown for notes. 
	  
	  Here is example flash card in markdown
	  ``What is main goal of autoencoder? #card
	  Encoder - learning latent representation of the data 
	  Decoder - learning how to recreate data from latent representation``
	  
	  Which follows pattern:
	  Question? #card
	  Tab space - answer for question
	  Instruction:
	  Based on above pattern create a set of markdown flash cards about self-supervised learning
	  Avoid creation of cards about examples.
