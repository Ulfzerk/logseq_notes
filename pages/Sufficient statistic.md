- Statistic is **sufficient** with respoect to a statistical models and its associated unknow parameter if
	- "no other statistic that can be calculated from the same sample provides any additional information as to the value of the parameter"
	- In fact there is a function $T(X)$ where X is a sample of data, which allows to compute any estimate of the parameter (e.g. a maximum likelihood estimete).
