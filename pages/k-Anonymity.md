- What is k-Anonymity? #card
	- K-Anonymity is a data anonymization technique that is used to protect individuals privacy in a dataset. It involves data generalization, data masking or replacing Personally Identifiable information (PII), with pseudonym to ensure no single individual can be identified.
- When dataset is k-anonymous? #card
	- A dataset is considered K anonymous when, for every combination of identifying attributes in a dataset, there are at least "K - 1" other people with the same attributes. In the words, the data is not unique to a certain individual, and therefore can't be used to identify them.
- How does K-anonmymit works? #card
	- K anonymity technique works by grouping similar individuals together and generalizing, or suppresing, data fields that contain identyfing information.
- What are main issues with k-anonymity? #card
	- Outliers make achieving k-anonymity very challenging, even for large datasets. Optimal generalization for k-anonymity is NP-Hard
	- Finding the right K
		- It can be difficult without expert knowledge
	- Risk of re-identification
		- As K increases the risk of re-identification decreases, but it's never eliminated.
		- So K anonymity can't guarantee 100% privacy proctection.
		- Linkage attacks
	- Diminished data utlility
		- K anonymity can lead to reduced data functionality because some information may need to be altered to achieve the desired level of anonymity.
	- Vulnerablility to insider threats
		- Can be susceptible to attacks and unintentional breaches by insiders who have access to the anonymized data and additional information.
	- It's expensive to check with ${O(n^2)}$ complexity
	- Homogeneity attacks
