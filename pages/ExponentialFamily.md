# Definition
- Consider a random variable X taking values $x \in \mathcal{X} \subset \mathcal{R}^n$. A probability distirbution for X with pdf of the functional form
  $p_w (X) = h(x) exp [\phi(X)^T W - log Z(w)] = \frac{h(X)}{Z(w)}e^{\phi(x)^T * w } = p(x|w)$
  is called an exponentail family of probability measures.
