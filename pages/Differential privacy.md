- What is Differential privacy? #card
	- Property of algorithms not data
	- Algorithm satisfies differential privacy when dataset produced by this algorithm satisfies differential privacy.
	- We can se that a mechanism F satisfies differential privacy if for all neighboring datasets x and x' and all possible sets of outpus S 
	  $\frac{P(F(x) \in S}{P(F(x') \in S}$
	- It states that F's (algorithm/transformation) will be pretty much the same with or without the data of any specific individual.
