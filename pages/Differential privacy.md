- What is Differential privacy? #card
	- Property of algorithms not data
	- Algorithm satisfies differential privacy when dataset produced by this algorithm satisfies differential privacy.
	- We can se that a mechanism F satisfies differential privacy if for all neighboring datasets x and x' and all possible sets of outpus S 
	  $\frac{P(F(x) \in S}{P(F(x') \in S} <= e^{\}$
	- It states that F's (algorithm/transformation) will be pretty much the same with or without the data of any specific individual.
	- Randomness built into F shoud be "enough" so that an observed output from F will not reveal which of x or x' was the input.
- \epsilon is a privacy parameter / privacy budget.
	- This is a knob to tune the "amount of privacy".
	- Small values of \epsilon require F to provide very similar outputs when given similar inputs. And therefore provide higher level of privacy.
	- Large values of \epsilon allows less similarity in the outputs and therefore provide less privacy
	- How much \epsilon is enough?
		- nobody knows
		- General consensus is that \epsilon should be around 1 or smaller and values abouve 10 probably don't do much to protect privacy.
