- What is Zero-Shot Classification? #card
	- Zero-shot text classification is a task in natural language processing where a model is trained on a set of labeled examples but is then able to classify new examples from previously **unseen** classes
- About the Zero shot classification task
	- Zero shot classification is the task of predicting a class that wasn't seen by the model during training.
	- Uses pre-trained language model
	- Can be thought of as an instance of transfer learning which generally refers to using a model trained for one task in a different application than what it was originally trained for. 
	  This is particularly useful for situations where the amount of labeled data is small
	-
- **Useful for:**
	- When we have small amount of labeled data
- What is a diffrence between Zero shot classification and single/one few-shot classification #card
