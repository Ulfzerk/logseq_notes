### Inference problem
	- An inference problem requires statements about the value of an unobserved (latent) variable X based on observations y which are related to x, but may not be sufficient to fully determine x. This requires a notation of uncertainty

- Keywords / Glossary :
	- Observed, Observations - data etc.
	- Unobserved (latent) - hypothesis - latent quantity etc.
- Notes
	- This kind of reasoning is computably expensive, so it is common to use approximations, tricks and tricks.
- Baysian Teorem
	- $P(A|B)=\frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B|A)P(A) +P(A|~B)P(~B)}$
	- P(A|B) - Posterior probability, so probability after seeing observations. Result of inference?
	- P(A) - Prior - probability of event before inference e.g. How often someone is ill with covid? It is unconditioned.
	- P(B|A) - Likelihood - conditional probability of an event given observations. e.g. How probable is to have covid given a positive test.
	- Denominator - where we relate probabilities with all possible observations of the data. So it is a normalization based on all possibilities.
