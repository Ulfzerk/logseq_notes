- What is a Linkage attack? #card
	- Linkage attacks are using auxiliary (addtional) data to re-identify de-identified data.
	- For example if we know someones birth data and his zip-code, it might be possible to re-identify his data.
	- The more auxiliary data we have, the easier it is to perform this kind of attack
- It diffrent datasets, some attributes can be very selective. We can look on how many unique values there are in dataset to assume selecitivty. For example ZIP-code is very selective.
	- Also a pair of attributes is always more selective than a single one. But it is harder to get.
