	- # Gibbs Inequality
	  
	  Gibbs inequality states that for any probability distribution \(P = (p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n)\) and any other probability distribution \(Q = (q_1, q_2, \ldots, q_n)\), the following inequality holds:
	  
	  \[ \sum_{i=1}^n p_i \log \frac{p_i}{q_i} \geq 0 \]
	  
	  Equality holds if and only if \(P = Q\).
	  
	  This inequality is a fundamental result in information theory and is often used in the context of relative entropy (Kullback-Leibler divergence).
