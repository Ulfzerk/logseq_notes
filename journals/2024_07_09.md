- nCheck theta dimensions
- Check if there is a problem with just one clique

- Exp 1
	- Marginal over all attributes A_0, A_1
	- Dataset with 200 rows of 000 or 111
	- It is a 0.5 / 0.5 prob to sample each tuple given z
- Exp 2
	- We change marginal to have
		- One marginal over all attributes A_0, A_1
		- One marginal over A_0 only.
	- Same dataset
