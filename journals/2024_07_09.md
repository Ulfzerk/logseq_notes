- nCheck theta dimensions
- Check if there is a problem with just one clique
-
- Exp 1
	- Marginal over all attributes A_0, A_1
	- Dataset with 200 rows of 00 or 11
	- It is a 0.5 / 0.5 prob to sample each tuple given z
- Exp 2
	- We change marginal to have
		- One marginal over all attributes A_0, A_1
		- One marginal over A_0 only.
	- Same dataset
	- It stays more-or-less 0.5 to 0.5 (0.49999 to 0.5000001....)
- Exp 3
	- We add another marginal this time over A_1
	- So we have 3 marginals M_1_0, M_0, M_1
	- probablities stays the same.
- Exp 4
	- Lets add to dataset 50 tuples with 1,0 values
	- Probability values went crazy. Despite the fact that 1,0 values are only 20% of dataset. Probability of sampling 1,0 is now 0.99 %
	- Why is that?
		- Theta values for latent attributes are dominating
